# README Generator - sample README

  ## Description <a name="description"/>
  
  ### Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
  - What was your motivation?
  - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  - What problem does it solve?
  - What did you learn?

    This is a sample README created by this README generator.
  
  ## Table of Contents (Optional)
    If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need. Like the following:
  - [Project Description](#description)
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Contributing Guidelines](#contribute)
  - [Testing Instructions](#testing)
  - [Questions/Contact](#questions)
  
  
  ## Installation <a name="installation"/>
    What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
  Fork and clone using git. Run index.js to create a README.
  
  ## Usage  <a name="usage"/>
    Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
  Install Node.js - I'm using version 8.2.4. Make sure dependencies are listed in package.json. Then run node index.js at repo root to receive and answer some prompts to write a README.md!

  ## How to Contribute <a name="contribute"/>
    If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
  Email me or simply make a pull request.
  
  ## Tests <a name="testing"/>
    Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
   No testing has been created. Install jest and create testing files if necessary.
